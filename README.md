## Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a face and eye detection system using OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifiers. The project utilizes two XML files for the Haar Cascade classifiers:
- `haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml`: For detecting frontal faces.
- `haarcascade_eye.xml`: For detecting eyes.

The detection is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, which provides a step-by-step guide on how to apply these classifiers to detect faces and eyes in images.

## Files Description

- `haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml`: XML file containing the Haar Cascade classifier for frontal face detection.
- `haarcascade_eye.xml`: XML file containing the Haar Cascade classifier for eye detection.
- `Detect_face_and_eyes.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the face and eye detection process.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed along with the libraries `opencv-python` and `notebook`.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
4. Follow the steps in the notebook to perform face and eye detection on sample images.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- OpenCV 4.0 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
